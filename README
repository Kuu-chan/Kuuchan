##Care About Your Craft
Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

##Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done; explain what can be done.

##Be a Catalyst for Change
You can’t force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.
